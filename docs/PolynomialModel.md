# PolynomialModel

The PolynomialModel class is a derived class of the [LinearModel](SimpleModel.md) abstract class that allows for the user to adjust the capacity/parameters of the predictive model by altering the degree of the underlying polynomial functions.


## Features

The PolynomialModel class can learn more complex non-linear relationships between training input and outputs. This is achieved by
