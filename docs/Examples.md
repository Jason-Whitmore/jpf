# Examples

The Examples.java class provides demonstrations of model usage, including model creation, training, prediction, and saving models to disk.
These examples also serve as black box tests to ensure that the model functionality behaves as expected.
The class also provides an easy command line interface to run these examples. To use, simply include the example name as the only argument
when running. For example:

`javac Examples.java`

`java Examples simplelinear`

Compiles the Examples class and then runs the "simplelinear" example. For a list of all argument strings, simply provide no argument when
executing the program.

In this document, a brief description of each example will be provided alongside the program output
