# LinearModel

The LinearModel class is the simplest derived class of the SimpleModel abstract class.

## Features

The LinearModel can learn simple linear relationships between training inputs and outputs.

Mathematically, a LinearModel instance can be described using linear algebra:

where all entries in the weight matrix A, and bias vector b are learnable parameters.

Additionally, each component of the output vector can be described as:

where theta_i,j and b_i are learnable parameters.
