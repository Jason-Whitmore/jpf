# Activation Functions

Activation functions are a simple mapping from real numbers to real numbers that are used in Dense Neural Network layers. Most of these activation functions are non-linear in nature, which allow the neural network to approximate non-linear functions.

These functions are implemented using the ActivationFunction interface.

## ActivationFunction interface

The ActivationFunction interface, found in ActivationFunction.java, provides the basic template for derived classes to implement functionality.
